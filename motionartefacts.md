some methods we can use to remove spurious noise from PPG signals due to motion artefacts could be :

1. Low pass filter -> to remove 8-12 hz signals
2. Notch Filter -> to remove 50-60 Hz dirty noise signals
3. band pass fitler in 2-6hz range
4. Adaptive noise cancellation using least mean squares algorithm
